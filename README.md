# Networks-Project
Structure data to be used for analysis using Gephi software.

Using the Starwars Network Data found here: https://github.com/evelinag/star-wars-network-data/blob/master/starwars-full-interactions.json. Converted the JSON file to multiple CSVs and added information found at this link  into the nodes table about specific charecters. Ultimately, created a Gephi project that breaks down networks of interactions between characters and uses additional information including Affiliations, Locations, and Species.
